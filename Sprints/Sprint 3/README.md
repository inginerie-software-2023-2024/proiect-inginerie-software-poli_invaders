# Sprint Report 3 (Jan 1 - Jan 12)

## Team overview

Tillinger Marius, Balescu Alexandru and Harnagea Andrei have been available for this sprint.

## Backlog status

In this sprint we have worked on the following user story:  
> As a user I want to be able to unlock new levels so that there is a sense of progress.

We were unable to work on other user stories in this sprint.

## Planned items status

For the user stories that we have worked on, we have achieved the following:

- we have created a new screen to showcase the different levels you can play;
- we have implemented 2 new scenes that put the player in a different enviorment;

The unresolved user stories will pe considered for future sprints.

## Sprint review

While the development of the select screen and the 2 other enviorments has been completed, we have not been able to implement the unlocking of levels. 
<br>This is a rather big problem as it was a core feature of the game, and we will have to work on it in the future sprints if we are able to.
<br>Another problem is the current exam season which is taking a toll on all the members of the team. We are unable to work on the project as much as we would like to.

## Sprint retrospective

While we are dissapointed by some of the results of this sprint, we are still happy with the progress we have made. We have created a new screen and 2 new scenes, which is a lot of work.
