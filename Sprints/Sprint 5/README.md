> As a user I want to have a choice in the type of gameplay(melee/ranged) so that I can play in a style I am more comfortable in.

We were unable to work on other user stories in this sprint, but since it was the last sprint we went over and corrected old functionality that was not working as intended.

## Planned items status

For the user stories that we have worked on, we have achieved the following:

- we have resolved errors regarding the pick-up of powerups and the registration of collisions

We considered this to be the final addition to the game

## Sprint review

Finished the main functionality of the game, it is in a playable state.

## Sprint retrospective

The game is overall playable and even interesting. Compared to what we could've achieved we are far from our initial goal, but we are satisfied with the result. We have learned a lot about Unity and game development in general. We have also learned a lot about working in a team and how to manage our time better. 
<br> We have also learned some new Unity skills and we have improved our C# knowledge.
