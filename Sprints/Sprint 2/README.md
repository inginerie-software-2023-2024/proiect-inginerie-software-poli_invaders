## Team overview

Moldoveanu Stefan, Harnagea Andrei and Tillinger Marius have been available for this sprint.

## Backlog status

In this sprint we have worked on the following user story:  
> As a user I want to have access to remote multiplayer so that I can enjoy the game with someone else.
> As a user I want to have access to a leaderboard to keep track of my progress

We were unable to work on other user stories in this sprint.

## Planned items status

For the user stories that we have worked on, we have achieved the following:

- we have implemented a multiplayer enemy spawner, and synchronized enemy health;
- we have implemented synchronized player health and a replay functionality;
- we have created and added new sprites for the enemies;
- we have established a firebase connection to keep score data in the leaderboard

The unresolved user stories have been pushed to the following sprints.

## Sprint review

The multiplayer aspect is close to being complete, however in other aspects the project is not close to an MVP. The goals have not changed.

## Sprint retrospective

Development is progressing well, and the efficiency in multiplayer implementation has improved since the last sprint.
