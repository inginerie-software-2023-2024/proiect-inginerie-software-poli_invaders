The unresolved user stories have been pushed to the following sprints. Some prior functionality we hoped to finish has been abandoned.

## Sprint review

Exam season is harder than anticipated. We were unable to come together and talk / work on the project topics. 
<br>We have dediced to abandon some of the ideas that felt like perfectionism and focus on the core functionality of the game.

## Sprint retrospective

Being close to the deadline, we are not sure if we will be able to finish the project. We will try to finish as much as possible and hope for the best.
