# Sprint Report 1 (Nov 27 - Dec 11)

## Team overview

Moldoveanu Stefan has been available for this sprint.

## Backlog status

In this sprint we have worked on the following user story:  
> As a user I want to have access to remote multiplayer so that I can enjoy the game with someone else.

We were unable to work on the other user stories in this sprint.

## Planned items status

For the user stories that we have worked on, we have achieved the following:

- we have implemented the ability to join a multiplayer game;
- we have implemented a scene with two players, with synchronized player movement;

The unresolved user stories have been pushed to the following sprints.

## Sprint review

The project is still in an early stage, therefore it is not close to an MVP. The goals have not changed.

## Sprint retrospective

Development is progressing well, however implementation of multiplayer is slightly slower than expected. We hope to improve that aspect in the following sprints.
