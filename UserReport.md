# User Report

The users, upon entering the application were greeted with a comprehensive menu. They navigated easily through the different screens. 

The users were a bit confused by the fact that the keyboard wasn’t used as an input type, but after learning that only a mouse is necessary, they quite liked the simplicity of the controls. 

The users were satisfied by the UI, however they found that there is room for improvement:

- Multiplayer button and the multiplayer option buttons weren’t in theme with the rest of the game
- The Score is not very visible for the Luca and Cafenea levels
- The writing on the Luca level buildings doesn’t fit in with the theme of the level

The users also found room for improvement regarding the Multiplayer mode:

- The multiplayer joining code could be a bit shorter for better sharing among players
- The real time multiplayer could be better by having less lag
- The join public option is not displaying any screen
